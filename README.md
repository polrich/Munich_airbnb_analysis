When you are planning to visit a major city, such as munich, finding a suitable and affordable accommodation is often tedius. But what are the main affects that influence prices? Is it the particular part of the city, the distance to the clostest underground station, the time of the year, the simultaneous occurance of trading fairs or Oktoberfest, ratings and reviews of an accommodation or simply the amenities provided by the host? Is it possible to save some money without losing comfort?
